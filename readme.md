## TYPESCRIPT: The very beginning. (Study pattern: Book + Code)

    - Typescript is typed superset of JavaScript that compiles directly to JavaScript code.
    - Typescript makes JavaScript more strongly-typed, recommended for larger sized projects.
    - Strong typing enables that the language is pre-compiled and the variables cannot be assigned values that are out of scope/range.
    - Easier to debug, maintain, sleep peacefully at night, no fking headaches :)
